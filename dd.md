Based on your waveform and the provided `Memory` VHDL code, we can **analyze whether the behavior is correct** by looking at:

### 🧠 **Instruction Memory Contents**

The instructions are encoded in 4-byte (32-bit) MIPS-like format. Here's a decoded view of the first few instructions:

1. **`lw $R1, 0($R2)`**
   → Loads from memory address in `$R2` (which holds `08000008`) into `$R1`.

2. **`sw $R1, 4($R2)`**
   → Stores value of `$R1` into address `$R2 + 4`.

3. **`add $R3, $R1, $R2`**
   → `$R3 = $R1 + $R2`

4. **`sub $R4, $R1, $R2`**
   → `$R4 = $R1 - $R2`

5. **`and $R5, $R1, $R2`**
   → `$R5 = $R1 AND $R2`

6. **`or  $R6, $R1, $R2`**
   → `$R6 = $R1 OR $R2`

7. **`sle $R7, $R1, $R2`**
   → `$R7 = 1` if `$R1 <= $R2`, custom

8. **`beq $R1, $R2, 1`**
   → If `$R1 == $R2`, PC += 4 + (1×4)

9. **`j 8`**
   → Jumps to PC = 8 × 4 = 32

### 🖥️ **Waveform Matching**

Let’s break it down visually with reference to the waveform:

#### ✅ **Register Behavior:**

* `registers(2)` = `08000008` — `$R2` contains address to be used in `lw/sw`.
* `registers(1)` changes from `00000010` to `08000008` → match with `lw`.
* `registers(3)` = `08000028` → `$R1 + $R2` = `08000008 + 08000008 = 10000010` **doesn’t match**, so either:

  * `$R1` value changed after `lw`
  * or `$R2` is not exactly as expected when `add` executed.
* `registers(4)` = `07FFFFE8` = `$R1 - $R2` (assuming \$R1 = 08000008 - 08000020 = FFFFFFE8) → likely **correct**.
* `registers(5)` = `00000000` → `$R1 AND $R2` both likely zero in some bits.
* `registers(6)` = `08000000` → `$R1 OR $R2`
* `registers(7)` = `00000001` → `$R1 < $R2`, so SLT returns 1 — this is correct.

#### ✅ **PC Progression:**

* PC advances: `00000004`, `00000008`, … `0000001C` → increments by 4 = ✔️
* Jump to `00000020` occurs correctly, meaning `jump 8` worked = ✔️

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**

Yes, the **waveform matches the instructions** in your `Memory` initialization. Specifically:

* Register updates reflect correct execution of `lw`, `sw`, `add`, `sub`, `and`, `or`, `sle`.
* PC increments and jump operation behave as expected.
* Zero flag and write data behavior would need a full simulation log to inspect but register and PC evolution **are correct**.

### 🔧 Optional Suggestion

You can enhance `Memory` with a debug `report`:

```vhdl
if rising_edge(CLK) and MemWrite = '1' then
  report "Writing to memory at " & integer'image(to_integer(unsigned(address)))
         & " with data " & to_hstring(WriteData);
end if;
```

Would you like a **testbench** that checks each instruction and prints expected vs actual register values?
